## RUN 1 (no change)
Overall Experience: 3.5 years

Relevant Experience: 2.5 years

Notes: Overall Experience was calculated from the start of the first job (June 2017) to the end of the most recent job (present). Relevant Experience includes roles that directly relate to the skills and responsibilities outlined in the Job Description, such as graphic design work using Adobe programs, customer service, and administrative tasks. The Breton Bay Country Club position was a seasonal job and only lasted for one year and a half, while the Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill position and the Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group position are both still ongoing as of October 2024. The Campus Involvement section was not considered in the calculation of relevant experience since it does not directly relate to the skills and responsibilities outlined in the Job Description.


## RUN 2 (no change)
Overall Experience: 3.5 years

Relevant Experience: 2 years

Notes: Overall Experience was calculated from the start of the first job (June 2017) to the end of the most recent job (present). Relevant Experience includes roles that directly relate to the skills and responsibilities outlined in the Job Description, which are primarily limited to the Administrative Assistant position at Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group. The Breton Bay Country Club and Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill jobs do not have direct relevance to the marketing role described in the job posting. Additional Considerations: No gaps in employment or part-time work were noted on the provided resume.


## RUN 3 (removed example, added important section)
Overall Experience: 5.5

Relevant Experience: 3.5

Notes:

Overall Experience was calculated by subtracting the graduation year from the current date (2018 to 2024) for full-time work experience, and dividing the seasonal work period (June 2017 to August 2018) by 2 (since it occurred twice in the 6-year span).
Relevant Experience was calculated by considering only the jobs that directly relate to the skills and responsibilities outlined in the Job Description. This includes the Administrative Assistant position at Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group, LLC (June 2020 - Present) and the Restaurant Hostess position at Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill (May 2019 - August 2019). The Breton Bay Country Club Lifeguard position was included due to its relevance in terms of teamwork, safety, and emergency response skills. The part-time nature of these jobs was accounted for by dividing the duration by the number of years (full-time work is typically considered as 40 hours per week).


## RUN 4 (changing calculation section, change temp to 0.1, )
Overall Experience: 3 years 10 months

Relevant Experience: 2 years 4 months

Notes:

The Breton Bay Country Club position was a seasonal job from June 2017 to August 2018, totaling 2 years.
The Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill position was also a seasonal job from May 2019 to August 2019, totaling 4 months. Since this role is not directly related to the Job Description, it is not included in the Relevant Experience calculation.
The Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group, LLC position started in June 2020 and is ongoing as of October 2024, totaling 4 years 4 months so far. Since this role is directly related to the Job Description, it is included in the Relevant Experience calculation.
The Campus Involvement section does not provide specific dates, making it impossible to calculate the duration for these roles. However, since they are ongoing and relevant to the Job Description, they should be considered as part of the Relevant Experience.
The overall experience is calculated by adding the durations of all jobs (Breton Bay Country Club, Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill, and Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group, LLC) without double-counting overlapping periods. The total duration is 2 years + 0 months (Ruddy Duck Brewery & Grill is not included in the calculation since it's not relevant to the Job Description) + 4 years 4 months = 3 years 10 months.
The relevant experience is calculated by including only the Air Combat Effectiveness Consulting Group, LLC position, which totals 4 years 4 months so far. Since this role is directly related to the Job Description, it is included in the Relevant Experience calculation.
